    /* Enter loop
     * - Print cow according to current fitness level
     * - Print current stock
     * - Ask user what value of lunchfood they want to give to the cow, checking it is greater than stock.
     * - If stock is negative, value of lunchfood has to be zero
     * - Update fitness
     *      fitness_update(int lunchfood)
     *      - can access fitness
     *      - generate digestion
     *      - return (fitness + lunchfood) + digestion
     *
     * - If fitness between 1 and 9 inclusive,
     * - Then increment duree_de_vie
     * - Then update stock to add or subtract randomly generated crop and proceed with the loop.
     *      This is achieved with stock_update(int lunchfood) within which we
     *      - can access stock, even though we're in a new function
     *      - generate crop
     *      - return (stock-lunchfood) + crop
     * - Else break out of the loop - we have lost the game
